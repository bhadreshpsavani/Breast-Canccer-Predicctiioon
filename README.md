# Beast Cancer Prediction with Azure ML

We will do Binary Classification on breast cancer dataset. Our Goal is to compare Hyperdrive and AutoML trained modela and deploy the best performing model.

First we will use HyperDrive to do Hyperparameter Tuning and get best performing model. We will use Automl and get Best performing model. We will compare best model from both the approach and deploy it. We will do inference on deployed model.

## Project Set Up and Installation


## Dataset

### Overview
The breast cancer dataset is a classic and very easy **binary classification** dataset.

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Classes | 2 |
| Samples per class | 212(M),357(B) |
| Samples total | 569 |
| Dimensionality | 30 |
| Features | real, positive |

We used sklearn version of dataset

### Task
Our task is to do Binary Classification on Breast Cancer Dataset, we will use all 30 features for training and testing.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording


## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
